  This package contains the following elements.

    The actual userspace tracing library that must be linked to the
    instrumented programs.

  - Documentation

  - hello
    An example application that uses the userspace tracer.

    in any program without need to recompile it.

  - libinterfork
    A library that is LD_PRELOAD'ed, and that hijacks calls to several system
    calls in order to trace across these calls.

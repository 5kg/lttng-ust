- port changes from recent versions of lttng kernel (in progress by pmf)
- make cli interface for changing subbuffer size and number (in progress by Douglas Santos)
- performance testing tool (in progress by Rafik Fahem)
- add buffering for receiving side in libustcomm
- improve support for combined kernel/userspace tracing
- make a trace testing script (that can assert whether a trace contains certain events)
- make web site
- document API
- make sure the proper structures are cacheline aligned, and test performance, including multi-threaded
- use signal safe snprintf
- fix all valgrind errors
- test with smaller subbuffer sizes
- fix header/lib priority problem at compilation
- fix FIXME's in the code
- make a system (signal-based?) that allow the listener thread to not be started initially
- make cli interface for flight recorder
- save_registers: save them only when the marker is active (complicated because we need to know their value at the address that is put in struct marker)
- make streaming work
- ustd should work as a pool of threads
- support multiple simultaneous traces
- update viewer to support alignment of ust traces taken on different systems

- port changes from recent versions of lttng kernel (in progress by pmf)
- update to trace format 2.5 (in progress by pmf)
- make a trace testing script (that can assert whether a trace contains certain events)
- make web site
- make sure the proper structures are cacheline aligned, and test performance, including multi-threaded
- use signal safe snprintf
- test with smaller subbuffer sizes
- fix header/lib priority problem at compilation
- fix FIXME's in the code
- make a system (signal-based?) that allow the listener thread to not be started initially
- make cli interface for flight recorder
- make cli interface for changing subbuffer size and number
- add \n at end of messages in communication protocol
